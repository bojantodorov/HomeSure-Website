              <li><strong>Photos and Images:</strong> Photos of property defects or repairs that you upload through the App. These photos are:

                  <li>Device push notification tokens stored for sending updates</li>
                  <li>Notification preferences and settings</li>
                  <li>Notifications sent include: snag assignment updates, contractor status changes, quote submissions and approvals, comment replies, and appointment confirmations</li>
                  <li>Push notifications can be disabled through your device settings at any time</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> For contractor users only, precise location is collected when:
                <ul>
                  <li>Contractors manually click the "Arrived" button to confirm on-site presence at a property</li>
                  <li>Used solely to verify contractor arrival for scheduled appointments</li>
                  <li>Location is captured at a single point in time (not continuous tracking)</li>
                  <li>We do not collect location data in the background</li>
                  <li>Residents/tenants are not required to share location data</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Quote Information:</strong> Contractor-submitted quotes, pricing details, work descriptions, supporting documents, approval status</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 Technical Information</h3>
            <p>We automatically collect certain technical information when you use our Services:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, device identifiers</li>
              <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> App features used, time spent in the App, error logs</li>
              <li><strong>Network Information:</strong> IP address, mobile network information</li>
              <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> AWS Cognito authentication credentials, session tokens, email verification status, password change history (passwords are encrypted and not stored in plain text)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.4 User Roles and Data Access</h3>
            <p>Our App serves different user types with varying data access levels:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Residents/Tenants:</strong> Can create snag reports, upload photos, view assigned contractors, communicate with property managers and contractors, view quotes and approval status</li>
              <li><strong>Contractors:</strong> Can view assigned snag reports, access resident contact information for assigned jobs, submit quotes, upload completion photos, communicate with residents and property managers, confirm arrival at properties</li>
              <li><strong>Property Managers:</strong> Have access to all resident and contractor data within their managed properties for administrative and coordination purposes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Information is shared between these user types as necessary for service delivery. For example, when a snag is assigned to a contractor, they receive access to the resident's contact information and property details.</p>

            <h2>3. Mobile App Permissions</h2>
            <p>Our mobile application requires specific device permissions to provide full functionality:</p>

            <h3>3.1 Camera Access</h3>
            <p>We request camera access to enable you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Take photos of property defects and damage directly within the App</li>
              <li>Capture before/after photos for repair documentation</li>
              <li>Document work completion for quotes and approvals</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may deny camera access, but you will need to use your device's camera app separately and upload photos from your photo library instead.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Photo Library Access</h3>
            <p>We request photo library access to enable you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Select and upload existing photos of property issues</li>
              <li>Attach supporting documentation to snag reports and quotes</li>
              <li>Upload photos taken outside the App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can deny photo library access, but you will need to use the camera directly within the App to take new photos.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Location Services (Contractors Only)</h3>
            <p>We request "When In Use" location permission for contractor users to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verify physical presence at the property when clicking "Arrived"</li>
              <li>Provide accountability for scheduled appointments</li>
              <li>Confirm service delivery for property managers and residents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Location is only collected when the contractor manually confirms arrival. We do not track location continuously or in the background. Contractors can deny location permission, but they must confirm arrival through alternative verification methods.</p>

            <h3>3.4 Push Notifications</h3>
            <p>We request push notification permission to send you important updates including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>New snag assignments (contractors)</li>
              <li>Contractor assignment notifications (residents)</li>
              <li>Quote submission and approval updates</li>
              <li>Comment replies and status changes</li>
              <li>Scheduled appointment reminders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings (Settings > Notifications > HomeSure). Disabling notifications may delay your awareness of important updates but will not prevent you from using the App.</p>
